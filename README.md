## DEV NOTES

### LEFT OFF - 

#### Beef up text fragment spawner

  Keep track of the current (active) fragment.  Maybe there should be an
  active pointer/instance var.

  When a spawner generates a new fragment, ensure that it doesn't get
  activated if another fragment is already active

  When a fragment is completed, if there is another live fragment, activate
  the next one in the array.

  Move the enemy (in the scene) to the right a bit.

### DONE - 
  Finish the first draft of the text fragment component
